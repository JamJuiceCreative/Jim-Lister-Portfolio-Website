          <h5>"A sign up page that puts the user into an endless loop"</h5>
          <p> As part of a learning exercise inlcuded in the coding bootcamp offered by Coder Academy I put 
            together the beginnings of a log-in page as requested by the class co-ordinators. I thought it a 
            fun concept to come up with a login page that loops back on itself and fixates the user in an endless loop of logging in. 
            Fundamentally only because the form is a practice exersice and is yet to be programmed on the back end. This in effect 
            kept the project simple as it was one of my first attempts at HTML and CSS. Basically the function will be as so; the user 
            will enter their details and the screens will flip, switching their positions, then the user will be asked to login again. 
            Sounds frustrating and would definitly be flagged as a user pain point however it ultimately only functions as a bit of a prank or a joke. <br><br>

            The things I learned attempting this project were the various forms for starters. I learned about the various properties like position and color, font-size and width.
            I learned how to assign various attributes to elements and style them into a component. I learned how to link images and play with the values such as opacity and corner-radius. 
            And I also learned how to divide components into various arrangements and label them semantically.

            <h5>"A website project for a mysterious pizza shop where the pizza goes missing before it gets to you"</h5>
            <p>Being a huge TMNT fan when given the opportunity to design a responsive website for a pizza restaurant, I thought who better to assign as the made up client than the turtles themselves. The website concists of fairly standard navigation with a navigation bar located within the heading. 
                It also concists of 4 pages of html styled in a basic css document. The main goal of this project was to learn about flex-box resposive styling so the use of flex-box is heavy throughout.<br><br>
                The artwork and initial design was created in figma where the approach was of a mobile first strategy. This allowed me to come up with the branding style and overall theme of the website on a mobile display first. I find this approach helpful as you can restrict the content down to only essential components and then add less- essential components as you scale larger to fill up the space. 
                It's also helpful when designing responsive websites as the cascading styles carry over to the larger viewports and can be overwritten, limiting the amount of duplicate code required in the css. <br><br>
                What I learned in this project was mostly the wide variety of functions that flex-box display opens you up to. 
                I learned more about syling properties like min and max-width which are important when creating responsive websites which also rely heavily on percentages.
