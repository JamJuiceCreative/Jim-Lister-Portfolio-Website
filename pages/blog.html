                    LG has developed a stretchable display that can be elongated from 12-inches in size to 14-inches. Stretchable displays are considered to be the next step of evolution for displays after rollable and foldable displays. The full-color display could find many applications within wearable technologies. LG has been developing the display since 2020 in collaboration with 20 South Korean research institutes.

                    Twitter's monetizable daily user growth has accelerated to more than 20% since Elon Musk's takeover. The growth indicates that users are not leaving the platform en masse. Many advertisers have left Twitter due to activist pressure, resulting in a massive drop in revenue for the company. The level of hate speech on the platform remains within historical norms.

                    A team of researchers from the UK has developed lab-grown blood and started human testing. Small amounts of the blood are being tested to see how it performs inside the body. The blood is created from a pool of stem cells, with the process taking about three weeks. Lab-grown blood is currently significantly more expensive than the cost of an average blood donation.

                    A group of AI researchers recently published a method of defeating KataGo, an AI Go-playing program, that involves playing unexpected moves outside of its training set. KataGo learned how to play Go by playing millions of games against itself. Despite the large number of games it was trained on, it still didn't experience every possible scenario. The research highlights the need for better automated testing of AI systems.

                    Signal is rolling out a new Stories feature that allows users to share images, videos, and texts that automatically disappear after 24 hours. Like everything else in the app, Stories are end-to-end encrypted. Users are able to opt out of the feature. Signal added Stories as it was one of the most commonly requested features.
